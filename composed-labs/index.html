            Ammar Mian here. I help early-stage startups unfuck themselves.
          <li>
            You've probably seen the startup curve before. Everyone obsesses over what Geoffrey Moore calls "crossing the chasm".
            The Chasm is the gap between your early niche successes and your ability to capture the larger market.
          </li>

          <li>
            You're laser-focused on making that jump. Many make the leap and many come crashing down.
          </li>

          <li>
            <img src="/img/chasm.jpg" style="width: 75%"/>
          </li>
          <li>
            Very few people realize that startups stall because they <em>can't move fast enough</em> to even be ready to make the jump.
          </li>
          <li>
            These teams aren't ready.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rival companies poach their best engineers.
            Prospective hires keep dropping out of the process to go work somewhere else.
            The deployment process is messy, buggy, undocumented, and slow.
            It feels like nothing new has been built in months.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the above means that you are not set up to ship and iterate fast enough to converge upon something great.
          </li>
          <li>
            Which is too bad, because this is your life's work. It needs to be great.
            You aren't spending all this time on an unproven idea just for it to be mediocre.
          </li>
          <li>
              This is where I come in.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            I work with startup leaders to clear bottlenecks, rapidly prototype new features, and get the ball rolling again.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the months you spent looking for someone to hire full-time, I'll have already shipped mission-critical work with your team.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am able to do this not because I'm a coding ninja. Honestly, I'm a pretty average programmer.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, I get clients results because I ask the <a href="/posts/on-questions" target="_blank">right questions</a> and work on the right things at the right time. Together, we'll prioritize
            what needs to get done. We'll go figure out the most practical and least grandiose way to do it.

              <p>
                Built a "Squarespace for Data Visualizations" tool for an overworked design studio. This cut development time on custom work from ~120h to ~1h.
              </p>

              <p>
                Helped an engineering team deploy new code 3x more often by writing a continuous integration system.
              </p>

              <p>
                Empowered community managers to serve their communities better by building a user exploration tool.
