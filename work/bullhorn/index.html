<h3 id="overview">Quick Summary</h3>
<p>We designed a proactive customer messaging system that reduced customer churn by 125% over 6 months.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roles</strong>: Product lead, UX/UI designer, frontend engineer, backend engineer</li>
<li><strong>Core Team</strong>: Director of Operations, Customer Success Lead</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: 4 weeks</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>KettleSpace runs charming coworking spaces out of restaurants and hotel lobbies. At a low monthly cost, freelancers and remote workers in New York City have unlimited access to the entire network of spaces.</p>
<p>KettleSpace’s internal motto: Work from Anywhere. This is an amazing mission. The company’s customers are building agencies, nonprofits, startups, and small businesses from their laptops, right around the corner from where they live.</p>
<p>However, as the company opened more locations, customer churn began to rise. My job was to figure out why this was happening and what KettleSpace could do about it.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>To get to the heart of the problem, I spent a week in anthropologist mode.</p>
<ol>
<li>I worked out of a different KettleSpace location every day to allow the physical experience to stick to my skin.</li>
<li>I supported my own observations with data. I ran SQL queries to find trends in customer complaints and cancellation reasons.</li>
<li>With the help of KettleSpace’s operations team, I shadowed a handful of customers to understand their daily experience using the service.</li>
</ol>
<p>Through this process, we discovered that customers were quite unhappy with unexpected interruptions and closures.</p>
<h3 id="discovery-the-core-problem">Discovery: The Core Problem</h3>
<p>Many of the most recently opened locations made last-minute changes to their hours of operations. A pipe burst, or a corporate group bought out the entire dining area, or a key staff member fell ill and wasn’t able to come in.</p>
<p>These last-minute changes disrupted whatever plans our customers had made. Important meetings. Dedicated heads-down time to hit deadlines. Job interviews and casting calls.</p>
<p>If customers could not trust our product enough to make plans involving it, they'd churn. They'd return to coffeeshop-squatting or paying a little extra for traditional office space. </p>
<p>I presented these customer insights to the KettleSpace team, and we determined there were three types of action we could take to address the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quality Control</strong>: Develop a stronger location vetting process.</li>
<li><strong>Information Access</strong>: Make it easier for customers to check location hours.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Customer Service</strong>: Immediately message customers if there were any last-minute changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The founders and I recognized that ultimately all three actions would need to be taken. And over the course of 6 months, all three actions were taken (which is a story for another time).</p>
<p>But which action could we take now that would lead to the highest immediate impact? Proactive customer service.</p>
<h3 id="discovery-key-insight">Discovery: Key Insight</h3>
<p>If we could get ahead of hard-to-predict failures, we could turn a potentially bad experience into customer delight.</p>
<p>Errors happen. Ideally we work to make sure they don’t happen. But it is in how we recover from these errors that transform liabilities into opportunities.</p>
<p>This is the calculus of early-stage startups (and also the calculus of your favorite grocery stores and airlines):</p>
<p>Satisfaction = Perceptions - Expectations</p>
<p>The KettleSpace team and I exited the discovery phase with a clear idea of what we needed to build: a calm, low-stress way to send messages to customers when unexpected interruptions occurred at their favorite locations.</p>

<h3 id="design-calm-and-low-stress">Design: Calm and Low-Stress</h3>
<p>What does it mean for a messaging system to be calm and low-stress? To uncover this quality, I spent a week sketching ideas, producing lo-fi wireframes, and speaking to the operations team that would be the primary users of the tool.</p>
<p>The operations team at KettleSpace are warriors. They run around the boroughs of New York making sure customers are happy in our spaces, restaurant operators are happy with our customers, and doing all the small things necessary to get through a single day.</p>
<p>For these operators, a calm design does one thing at a time. It does not present new actions until they are ready to be taken.</p>
<p>A low-stress design is one that adds friction in key areas to prevent mistakes. We definitely didn’t want an already stressed-out teammate to accidentally send a half-baked message to 200 people on a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>I tried my best to incorporate these two main qualities into the designs while maintaining KettleSpace’s existing design system.</p>
<p>After a few rounds of quick-and-dirty user tests and design iteration, we landed on a design that got the job done.</p>

<h3 id="results-125-reduction-in-churn">Results: 125% Reduction in Churn</h3>
<p>I was also the lead engineer on this project, so I took two weeks to switch gears and implement the design in code. We launched the Service Update tool, going from ideation to deployment in roughly 4 weeks.</p>
<p>And the results kinda blew my mind.</p>
<p>We saw customer churn drop by 125% and location-related complaints drop by XX% over the span of 6 months. This contributed to a strong period of growth for a small company of less than 20 employees.</p>
<p>Most importantly for me, this entire experience convinced the KettleSpace team to work from their own spaces. They terminated the lease on their office and began to fully eat their own dog food. Everyone became a user experience advocate after that.</p>
