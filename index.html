      <p> My name is Ammar Mian, and I'm a software engineer at Morning Consult. We're doing cool stuff around improving the collection and assessment of public opinion data.</p>
      <p> I read pretty obsessively. Here's a comprehensive list of books I've read and am currently working through.</p>
      <p> On a related note, I write quite a bit, usually about decision-making, society, and the self. Recent essays include: x, y, and z.</p>
