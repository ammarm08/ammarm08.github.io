      <h2><strong>Everyone Feels Relevant, Everything Feels Personalized</strong></h2>

    <p>
      There are three superpowers for the modern American. Before I say what those are, lemme do some suspense-building.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020 America, everyone feels relevant and everything feels personalized.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020 America, very few people are actually relevant and very few things are actually personalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Everyone feels relevant</strong>. After I finish writing this note, I'll post it in various forums, which altogether feel like The Whole World. Only a hundred or so people will see it. Only ten or so people will read it. But it feels as if everyone knows about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Everything feels personalized</strong>. Details of my browsing history get encoded into compressed hints so that my favorite apps can cater the right ads to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Very few people are relevant</strong>. The way we think, speak, and interact with each other originate from memes, songs, and movies. Obama, Trump, Oliver, Limbaugh. I am a mouthpiece for someone else's agenda.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Very few things are personalized</strong>. Many recommendation algorithms seek to reduce me down to a minimally complex, maximally valued field of characteristics. I am a consumer, I am not a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's funny, this chasm between the feeling and the reality. The environment around me convinces me that I matter, but this environment is working to make me not matter at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every detail of my life <em>feels</em> so important and consequential (the photo captions, the morning writing routine, the publishing schedule, the five-year plan).
    </p>
    <p>
      Every detail of my life is actually not as important as it is made to feel. Imagine the freedom with which we could construct our lives if this truth permeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very skeptical of Curtis Yarvin aka Mencius Moldbug's libertarian politics, but I do directionally agree with part of his answer in <em>A General Theory of Collaboration</em>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      "So everyone should disengage. Volunteers should disengage; they are probably just propping up a bad government. Dissidents should disengage; they are probably also just propping up a bad government."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      To me, disengagement does not mean "stop caring".
    </p>
    <p>
      Disengagement means actually observing the roles that we are playing, consciously or unconsciously. By observing them, we can fully and earnestly play these roles. Some of these roles are unwise. Only by feeling the fabric of our experience can we actually do something about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Ram Dass put it in his landmark text <em>Be Here Now</em>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      "Until you can hear your body, you cannot bring it under voluntary control in such a way that it helps you."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>
      And this brings me quite abruptly to the salve. There are three superpowers for the modern American. These super<strong>powers</strong> are such because they allow us to think deeply and create masterpieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are <strong>super</strong>powers because very few of us currently manifest them. The current atmosphere subverts our ability to think clearly and create honestly. We are stuck in cocoons of inadequacy and complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Superpower Numero Uno: Skepticism</strong>. The need to verify things for yourself. It's exhausting, but it sheds arrogance and protects you from bullshit peddlers. You learn who you can trust -- and these are typically the people telling you to try things for yourself anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Superpower Deux: Suspension of Disbelief</strong>. The embodiment of a proposed system despite your skepticism of it. Great ideas come from everywhere, and a lot of times they are buried in scabbed seeds. Try out something you disagree with and see what you end up learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Superpower Theen: Tolerance for Cognitive Dissonance</strong>. The holding of opposing beliefs together without dismissing one or the other. Just holding both up together, that is a closer approximation of the full picture of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through practice, you'll end up in a very bizarre place. Ideas that you once found dangerous make a tiny bit more sense. Ideas that you once found sacred make a tiny bit less sense. Ideas become expressions of emotions. Truth starts looking very different from the mere ordering of right and wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      These superpowers help us remove the black-and-white tint from our experience. We start empathizing with the experiences of everyone around us. We start realizing wisdom is small and hard-fought. We start thinking more clearly, speaking more honestly, and creating something magnificent out of our lives. We start to care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fuck relevance and personalization, we can finally be ourselves.
